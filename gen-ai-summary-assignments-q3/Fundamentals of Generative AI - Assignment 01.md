* Differentiate between AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and applied AI.  
    * AI: AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It is the technology that allows you to generate , classify and 
    perform tasks like image recognition and speech recignition
    * Machine Learning : ML means gettgin computers to learn without being explicity programmed. It is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make decisions and predictions based on that data
    * Deep Learning: A subset of Mchine Learning which uses neural networks with many 
    layes to analyze various types of data and significant amount of data.Neural Networks can be gone through supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning 
    * Genrative AI: Generative AI refers to subset of AI that involves creating new content , such as images, text, music , and more , rather than simply analyzing or interpreting the data.
    * Applied Generative AI: Leveraging pre-existing LLMS and foundational models to solve practial application problems by fine tunning them and integrating them in the application flows and existing business processes
